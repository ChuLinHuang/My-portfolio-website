                <h3>SLAM & Multi-Object Tracking on Autonomous Vehicle</h3>
                <p>In this project, I collaborated with 5+ teams to develop a SLAM-based localization 
                    system integrated with Multi-Object Tracking using YOLOv8 and Kalman Filter. The system 
                    leveraged Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and was benchmarked against GNSS and IMU ground 
                    truth for enhanced localization accuracy. Additionally, I calibrated LiDAR-camera 
                    extrinsics using the PnP method and applied DBSCAN clustering on the 3D point cloud, 
                    achieving an IoU of 0.68. This project showcases expertise in sensor fusion, computer 
                    vision, and autonomous navigation.</p>

                <h3>Monte Carlo Localization based on ROS with Lidar Simulation</h3>
                <p>Enhancing robotic autonomy through precise localization, this project focuses on 
                    Particle Filter Localization using LiDAR sensor data. I developed a LiDAR processing 
                    module to improve robot positioning accuracy and conducted extensive simulations on 
                    ROS and Gazebo platforms. These simulations allowed for iterative refinement and 
                    validation, ensuring reliable localization performance in dynamic environments. 
                    This project showcases my expertise in robot perception, probabilistic localization, 
                    and simulation-based validation for autonomous systems.</p>

                <h3>Lane Detection System on F1 Tenth Car</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on autonomous lane detection and path tracking using advanced computer 
                    vision and deep learning techniques. Implemented a collision avoidance algorithm powered by 
                    YOLOv8 and deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson platform for real-time inference. The controller logic 
                    was validated through Gazebo simulation, integrating perception and control components with ROS. 
                    Additionally, I fine-tuned camera calibration to correct distortion issues using OpenCV and 
                    Python, ensuring robust visual perception for enhanced navigation. This work showcases expertise 
                    in robotics, deep learning, and real-time autonomous systems.</p>

                <h3>CNNs Based on CUDA and C++</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using CUDA 
                    and C++, optimizing parallel programming and memory management to enhance GPU efficiency. 
                    Achieving 87% accuracy, I reduced convolutional operation time from 100ms to below 40ms 
                    for a batch size of 5000 by implementing tiled shared memory convolution and loop 
                    unrolling techniques. Additionally, I leveraged Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute for 
                    performance profiling and fine-tuning, ensuring optimal resource utilization for deep 
                    learning workloads. This work highlights my expertise in high-performance computing, GPU 
                    acceleration, and deep learning optimization.

                <h3>Multiple Images Stitching</h3>
                <p>Developed an automated image stitching pipeline that seamlessly aligns multiple images using feature 
                    detection, matching, and homography transformation. Inspired by AutoStitch, this system automatically 
                    identifies subsets, removes outliers, and stitches images together efficiently. To enhance alignment 
                    accuracy, I implemented RANSAC-based homography estimation, minimizing reprojection errors and filtering 
                    mismatched keypoints. This project showcases my expertise in computer vision, feature extraction, and 
                    image processing, contributing to advanced panorama generation and scene reconstruction.

                <h3>3D Reconstruction based on Shape from Shading</h3>
                <p>I reconstructed 3D surface maps utilizing the Shape from Shading technique, achieving accurate 
                    albedo and surface normal estimation. To enhance reconstruction precision, I developed preprocessing 
                    functions for light subtraction and intensity rescaling using least-squares methods. Additionally, 
                    I applied multi-path surface integration techniques to minimize 3D reconstruction errors, refining 
                    the depth estimation process. This project highlights my expertise in computer vision, 3D modeling,
